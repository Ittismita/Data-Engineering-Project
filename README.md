Olympic Data Analytics

Using Azure Cloud Services
### Understanding the Architecture
1. Data Source: Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo?resource=download&select=Athletes.xlsx
2. Data Factory: Integration services, to create, schedule and manage a simple pipeline.
                 Hence, extract data from data source and store in data lake storage.
                 Simplifies ETL.
4. Data Lake Storage: Store structured and unstructured data.
                      Raw data is stored here after extraction.
5. Transformation: Apply transformations on data through coding using Apache Spark on Azure Databricks environment.
6. Data Lake Storage: Store the transformed data.
7. Analytics: Using Azure Synapse Analytics.
8. Dashboard: Final viz created using any of the services like Power BI, Tableau etc.
